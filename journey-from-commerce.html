    <h3>1. Introduction: Where It All Began</h3>
    <p>
      When I first chose the commerce stream in high school, I imagined a future in business, finance, or management.
      It felt like a safe and practical choice, one that many students around me were making too. But deep down,
      I always had a spark for creativity and a fascination with how technology works. At the time, I didn’t realize
      that one day, that spark would evolve into a passion for web development.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing my HSC in commerce, I went on to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Applications (BCA).
      It was during this phase that I truly began to explore the world of tech — not just from a theoretical perspective,
      but hands-on. What started as curiosity slowly turned into something more meaningful.
      I was about to embark on a journey that would completely shift my career path — from commerce to code.

    <h3>2. The Turning Point: Discovering Code</h3>
    <p>
      I still remember the moment I stumbled upon a video about how websites are built. It showed someone writing a few
      lines of HTML and CSS, and instantly turning plain text into a styled webpage. That blew my mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curious, I decided to try it myself. I opened up a basic code editor, typed out a simple HTML file, and styled it
      with a bit of CSS. When I opened it in my browser and saw my first custom webpage come to life, I felt a sense of
      joy and accomplishment that I had never experienced with any subject before.
    </p>
    <p>
      That small experiment opened the doors to an entirely new world for me. I started diving into free resources,
      tutorials, and YouTube videos. Each new tag, style, and script I learned gave me the confidence to keep going.
      From there, I began building mini-projects — a to-do list, a simple calculator, even games. I realized that web
      development wasn't just about writing code — it was a way to bring ideas to life.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Learning & Growth</h3>
    <p>
      Once I realized how much I enjoyed web development, there was no looking back. I started with the basics —
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — building simple web pages and gradually adding interactivity to them. Each time I
      hit “refresh” and saw my code come to life, it pushed me to learn more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn’t have a roadmap at first, but I made one for myself. I took online courses, watched tutorials, and
      practiced by creating real projects. Some of the projects I built include a 
      <a href="https://rarestone0309.github.io/rarestone-youtube-clone/" target="_blank">YouTube Clone</a>, a 
      <a href="https://rarestone0309.github.io/Landing-page03" target="_blank">Modern Landing Page</a>, a 
      <a href="https://rarestone0309.github.io/product-card-example/" target="_blank">Product Card</a>, a 
      <a href="https://rarestone0309.github.io/Simple-Calculator/" target="_blank">Simple Calculator</a>, and a fun 
      <a href="https://rarestone0309.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors-/" target="_blank">Rock Paper Scissors Game</a>.
      Every project helped me improve my skills and boosted my confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually, I moved on to more advanced concepts like <strong>React.js</strong> and even started exploring the
      <strong>MERN stack</strong>. I also learned <strong>Bootstrap</strong> to improve my design skills and began
      working on responsive layouts. I wasn’t just writing code anymore — I was building experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most exciting parts of my journey has been creating my own 
      <a href="https://yourdomain.com/portfolio" target="_blank">portfolio website</a>. 
      It's more than just a collection of my work — it’s proof of how far I’ve come.

    <h3>4. Challenges Faced & Lessons Learned</h3>
    <p>
      Switching from commerce to coding wasn’t always smooth. In the beginning, the biggest challenge was simply
      understanding how programming logic worked. Coming from a non-technical background, terms like loops, arrays,
      and functions felt like a foreign language. There were days I’d spend hours debugging a small error or getting
      stuck on a single line of code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another challenge was consistency. Learning on your own means staying motivated without exams or deadlines
      pushing you forward. I had to build discipline — treating coding like a routine, even when progress felt slow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imposter syndrome also crept in sometimes. Seeing experienced developers build complex apps made me question my
      own abilities. But over time, I learned not to compare my Chapter 2 with someone else's Chapter 10.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each challenge taught me something: patience, problem-solving, and most importantly, that progress is more
      important than perfection. Every error became a lesson. Every stuck moment eventually led to a breakthrough.

    <h3>5. Final Thoughts: From Curiosity to Confidence</h3>
    <p>
      Looking back, I’m proud of how far I’ve come — from someone who didn’t know the difference between HTML and
      JavaScript, to someone who can now build websites and interactive projects from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      This journey wasn’t just about learning code. It was about transforming my mindset. I discovered that with
      consistency, curiosity, and a willingness to learn, I could break into a completely new field — even without a
      tech background.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know there’s still a lot to learn, and that excites me. Whether it’s diving deeper into frameworks like React,
      building full-stack applications, or contributing to real-world projects, I’m ready for what’s next.
    </p>
    <p>
      What started as curiosity has grown into confidence. And this is just the beginning.
